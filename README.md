# AI Camp WC2022 Team Creative Coders

In this repo, you'll find all the work and resources from a week-long training camp that I led at AI Camp. The focus of the camp was on exploring and analyzing a dataset of used car resales through the process of EDA.

To help guide the students through this process, we provided them with a mini project in the EDA_mini_project.ipynb file. They then took this knowledge and applied it to their individual work, which you can find in the individual-work folder. The final EDA was a combination of all the students' work, which can be found in the Final_EDA.ipynb file.

To keep everything organized and on track, we used the live Project_Plan.md file. The dataset we used, the car_data.csv file, was obtained from Kaggle. And for those who needed a refresher on Python, we provided some teaching material in the intro_to_python.ipynb file.

At the end of the camp, the students put their newfound skills to the test by building a streamlit webapp. The code for the app can be found in the main.py file and the requirements are listed in the requirements.txt file. 

You can check out the finished product at the following link: https://harishasan001-ai-camp-webapp-main-swpydr.streamlit.app/.
The demoo presenatation is also located in the AI Camp Creative Coders Demo pdf file

We hope you find all the resources and work in this repo useful!
